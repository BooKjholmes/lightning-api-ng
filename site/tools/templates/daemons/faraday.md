# Faraday

Welcome to the API reference documentation for Faraday.

Faraday is a suite of tools built to help node operators and businesses run [lnd](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd), the leading implementation of the [Lightning Network](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc). Faradayâ€™s tools decrease the operational overhead of running a Lightning node and make it easier to build businesses on Lightning. The current features in the Faraday suite provide insight into node channel performance and support for accounting with both on-chain and off-chain reports for lnd.

## Usage

Learn how to install, configure, and use Faraday by viewing the documentation in the [Builder's Guide](https://docs.lightning.engineering/lightning-network-tools/faraday/get-started).
