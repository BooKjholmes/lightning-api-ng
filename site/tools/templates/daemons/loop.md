# Loop

Welcome to the API reference documentation for Lightning Loop.

Lightning Loop is a non-custodial service offered by Lightning Labs to bridge
on-chain and off-chain Bitcoin using submarine swaps. This repository is home to
the Loop client and depends on the Lightning Network daemon loop. All of loopâ€™s
supported chain backends are fully supported when using the Loop client:
Neutrino, Bitcoin Core, and btcd.

The service can be used in various situations:

- Acquiring inbound channel liquidity from arbitrary nodes on the Lightning
  network
- Depositing funds to a Bitcoin on-chain address without closing active
  channels
- Paying to on-chain fallback addresses in the case of insufficient route
  liquidity
- Refilling depleted channels with funds from cold-wallets or exchange
  withdrawals
- Servicing off-chain Lightning withdrawals using on-chain payments, with no
  funds in channels required
- As a failsafe payment method that can be used when channel liquidity along a
  route is insufficient

## Usage

Learn how to install, configure, and use Loop by viewing the documentation in the [Builder's Guide](https://docs.lightning.engineering/lightning-network-tools/loop/get-started).
